I cannot generate the complete file content because the original file content provided is empty. To properly apply the diff, I need the actual original file content that contains the code being modified. The diff shows changes to JSX/React code with className modifications from "text-orange-600" to "text-yellow-600", but without the original file content, I cannot produce the complete corrected file.
